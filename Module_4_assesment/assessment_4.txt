1) Explain the connection procedure followed in client server communication.

*   Create Sockets: Both client and server will create their sockets. 
    The server creates a socket with the socket() function.

*   Server Binding: The server binds its socket to a specific address and port using the bind() function. 

*   Listening for Connections: The server socket enters the listening state using the listen() function. 
    This enables the server to accept incoming connection requests from clients. 

*   Client Socket Creation: The client creates its own socket similarly to the server.

*   Client Connection: The client initiates a connection to the server by using the connect() function. 
    The client specifies the server's IP address and port number to connect .

*   Server Acceptance: When a client attempts to connect, the server's accept() function is called.
    After connection, it returns a new socket dedicated to that particular client.

*   Data Transfer: Once the connection is established, both the client and server can exchange data through 
    their respective sockets using send() and recv() functions.

*   Closing Connections: After the communication is complete, both the client and server should 
    close their sockets using the close() function. This releases the network resources used for the connection.

2) What is the use of bind() function in socket programming?

In socket programming, the bind() function is used by servers to associate a specific IP address and port number with a socket. 
This establishes the server's listening address, enabling it to receive incoming connection requests from clients. 
bind() ensures that the server listens on the specified network interface and port, preventing conflicts with other processes.

3) What is Datagram Socket?

A datagram socket is a type of socket used in network communication, operating in a connectionless manner. 
It sends and receives data packets known as datagrams independently, without establishing a persistent connection. 
Datagram sockets are implemented using the User Datagram Protocol and are suitable for applications where real-time 
communication is required, such as streaming media or online gaming.
